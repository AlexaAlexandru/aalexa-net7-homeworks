Create human steps for 1 action : ACTION - prepare backpack for gym.

Step 1: GET the backpack
Step 2: Open the backpack and check to have the shoes:
	IF the shoes are present go to step 3
	ELSE find the shoes and put them into the backpack
Step 3: GET a shirt, a pair of trainers and a towel.
Step 4: FOR each item at step 3
	IF the item is on your wardrobe	THEN
	put the item into the backpack
	END IF
	END FOR
Step 5: Check to have the bottle of water into the backpack
Step 6: IF step 5 is true, check that the bootle has water
Step 7: IF step 6 is true go to step 9
Step 8: IF step 6 is false, get the bootle and fulfil it this water
Step 9: DISPLAY " the backpack is ready to be taken to the gym "


Create human steps for 2 action : ACTION - take out the garbage

Step 1: Get the garbage from the basket.
Step 2: If you can close with a node the garbage go to step 4
	ELSE take out another garbage bag and spit the garbage between them
Step 3: Check and remember  what kind of garbage is the one you are going to throw away
Step 4: Go to the trash station
Step 5: Check if trash container  1 is for the kind of garbage you have
Step 6: IF step 5 is false THEN :
	REPEAT step 5  for each trash container
	UNTIL trash container is the one of the kind of the garbage
Step 7: IF trash container is full 
	THEN look for another trash station in the area AND perform from step 5 to step 6.
	ELSE go to step 8
Step 8: Throw inside the trash container your garbage
Step 9: DONE

Sorting algorithm	: Sort the array following array with the complexity of ÎŸ(n2), whereas n is the number of items.

Given array: 14 | 33 |  27 | 35 | 10|

We check by couples and see with one is greater, if the second is greater we leave as it is, is it's smaller it will switch place with the first.

14 < 33 TRUE

Write algorithm. Point 4.1

DISPLAY ( insert your amount )

amount <- INPUT ()

tax = 0.005 * amount * 10

IF
	tax < 1 

	OUTPUT ( 1 )
ELSE
